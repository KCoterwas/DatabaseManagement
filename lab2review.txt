1. 

Evidence looks ok.

Good organization of screenshots.


2.

Excellent knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey.


3.

You did not discuss what fields were -nullable-.


4.

There are some typos in the responses. E.g., ``...meaning he information ...''.

The ``all rows must be unique'' explanation is right, but the example is wrong. Careful.
