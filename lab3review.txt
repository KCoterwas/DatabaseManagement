In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted queries compatible with the other group's database, with Alan's
  section. So, I am going to investigate this further. If I determine you are
  cheating, you will receive a failing grade in this assignment.
