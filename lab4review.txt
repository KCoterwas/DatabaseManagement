4. Get the ids of customers who ordered both product p01 and p07.

5. Get the ids of products not ordered by any customers who placed any order
through agent a07 in pid order from highest to lowest.

Incorrect SQL statement
- There was an additional semicolon. Not a runnable query.



7. Get all customers who have the same discount as that of any customers in
Dallas or London

Incorrect SQL statement
- You are missing a parenthesis


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You did not include -actual- check constraints examples, just descriptions of
  them. 


In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
